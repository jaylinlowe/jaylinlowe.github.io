    "text": "Hello! I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Statistics Department at the University of Michigan advised by Johann Gagnon-Bartsch. My research interests are broadly in survey statistics and casual inference, particularly in integrating auxiliary observational data sets with randomized datasets. I am interested primarily in applications to the social sciences, particularly education. Outside of work, I enjoy board games, baking, and swimming.\n\n\nEducation\nPhD in Statistics | University of Michigan |  2022-Present \nM.A. in Statistics | University of Michigan |  2022-2025 \nB.A. in Statistics | Carleton College |  2017-2021 \n\n\nPublications\n\nPower Calculations for Randomized Controlled Trials with Auxiliary Observational Data\nEducational Data Mining, 2024 Proceedings\nJaylin Lowe, Charlotte Mann, Jiaying Wang, Adam Sales, Johann Gagnon-Bartsch\nPDF   R Shiny\n\n\n\nTalks and Posters\n\nPower Calculations for Randomized Controlled Trials with Auxiliary Observational Data\nMichigan Student Symposium for Interdisciplinary Statistical Sciences (Feb 2025) and Joint Statistical Meetings (Aug 2024)\nJaylin Lowe, Charlotte Mann, Jiaying Wang, Adam Sales, Johann Gagnon-Bartsch\nMSSISS Slides   JSM Poster\n\n\nTools for Planning and Analyzing Randomized Controlled Trials & A/B Tests\nEducational Data Mining, Half Day Tutorial (July 2024)\nAdam Sales, Johann Gagnon-Bartsch, Duy Pham, Charlotte Mann, Jaylin Lowe\nSlides\n\n\n\nTeaching\nSTATS 604 - Statistical Practice  (Sept. 2024 - Dec. 2024) \nSTATS 470 - Introduction to the Design of Experiments  (Jan. 2024 - May 2024) \nSTATS 306 - Introduction to Statistical Computing  (Jan. 2023 - May 2023) \nSTATS 250 - Introduction to Statistics and Data Science  (Sept. 2022 - Dec. 2022) \n\n\nService\nPhD Student Council Recruitment Committee Co-Chair  (Sept. 2024 - Present) \nGraduate Student Mentor to Graduate Student Instructors  (Sept. 2024 - May 2025) \nUndergraduate Research Program in Statistics Mentor  (Jan. 2024 - Jun. 2024) \n\n\nAwards\nOutstanding Graduate Student Instructor Team Award Honorable Mention  (May 2025) \nMichigan Student Symposium for Interdisciplinary Statistical Sciences Honorable Mention Oral Session Award  (Mar. 2025)"
