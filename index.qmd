<p style="font-size: 18px;">Hello! I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Statistics Department at the University of Michigan advised by Johann Gagnon-Bartsch. My research interests are broadly in survey statistics and casual inference, particularly in integrating auxiliary observational data sets with randomized datasets. I am interested primarily in applications to the social sciences, particularly education. Outside of work, I enjoy board games, baking, and swimming.</p>
